# GUTFLY

### Fly, jump, dash, and stomp through constantly-spinning levels as quickly as possible, while assuming the role of a bacteria escaping the body of an unknown entity! A bad acid trip inspired by Sonic, Geometry Dash, and Super Meatboy.

This is a short proof-of-concept demo for a trippy speedrunning action game I made in 2-ish months during the summer of 2025, to test out basic game mechanics and art assets. The demo consists of 7 levels, each with varying difficulty, to demonstrate some potential ideas a hypothetical full game could feature. Work on the project, once again, came to a stop once I was back in university, but the core systems and ideas of the game are all here within this demo.

Everything you see here is the final demo's code (minus the video files which were too big), with some scripts not being as polished as others due to time constraints.
